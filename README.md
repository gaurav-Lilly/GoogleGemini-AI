# GoogleGemini-AI
iOS SwiftUI App Showcasing Google Gemini SDK

As part of exploring advanced AI integration in iOS, I’ve developed a SwiftUI-based application that leverages the latest Google Gemini model using the official Google AI Swift SDK.

🛠️ App Highlights:

✅ Integration with Google Gemini via Swift SDK

🧠 Multimodal prompting — supports input via text, images, and documents

🗣️ Real-time speech-to-text recognition using AVSpeechRecognizer

📄 Document and image upload with contextual understanding by Gemini

💬 Interactive chat interface to test prompts and AI responses live

📚 Official Documentation:
For implementation reference, check out Google’s official getting started guide:
👉 https://developers.google.com/learn/pathways/solution-ai-gemini-getting-started-swift


⚠️ Note:
To run the app, you’ll need to generate a Google AI Studio API key:
👉 https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Insert the API key into the app **ChatService** class.
